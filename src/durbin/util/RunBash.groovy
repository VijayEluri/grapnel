* Run a bash command line from groovy.  You can already run commands with syntax like:<br>
* <pre>

* </pre>
* That is about as simple as it gets and works great most of the time.  However, execute() runs 
* the given command passing it the list of options, the options are NOT passed through bash for 
* expansion and so on.  This class is an attempt to get around some of the rough edges of execute().
